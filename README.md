## Architecture

### Modular Service Design

The plugin uses a clean separation of concerns with two main services:

#### **WorkoutFileService**

- Handles all file operations (save, load, update workout files)
- Manages frontmatter parsing and generation
- Ensures data integrity with graceful error handling
- Supports multiple workouts per day with unique timestamps

#### **WorkoutStatisticsService**

- Calculates comprehensive workout statistics
- Tracks exercise frequency and personal records
- Computes workout streaks and progress metrics
- Provides time period analysis and progression tracking

This separation makes the codebase more maintainable, testable, and allows for easy extension of either file handling or statistical features.
